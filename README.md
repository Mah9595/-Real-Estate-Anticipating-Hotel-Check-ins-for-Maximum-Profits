# Real Estate Anticipating Hotel Check ins for Maximum Profits

It’s not easy running a hotel. You need a lot of manpower and it’s a constant tightrope of resource planning in order to maximize profits.

Hotel booking is also seasonal, which means you can use data to anticipate hotel stays and cancellations. In this UpLevel project, you harness the power of hotel vacancy data to help managers make important decisions about resource allocation.

This project has not just one, but two datasets—one a resort hotel and one a city hotel!
